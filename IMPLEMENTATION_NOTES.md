# Wallet Connect Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document provides information on the implementation of the WalletConnect functionality using Alchemy API in the Fleek Confidential Document Viewer application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Wallet Connection Module
Created a dedicated `wallet-connect.js` file with modular functionality:
- Implemented connection functions for WalletConnect and Coinbase Wallet
- Added wallet state management (connect, disconnect, restore)
- Added utility functions (getBalance, formatAddress)
- Used event-based architecture for wallet state management

### 2. Updated HTML Structure
- Added wallet connection libraries and scripts
- Added Coinbase Wallet SDK integration
- Added debug tools for troubleshooting wallet connection issues
- Added wallet tests script for testing connections

### 3. Modified Authentication Flow in script.js
- Updated to support both email and wallet authentication methods
- Added wallet authorization verification
- Enhanced UI for wallet connection display
- Added event handlers for wallet connection events

### 4. Added Debugging Support
- Created debug.js with comprehensive wallet connection diagnostics
- Added UI for testing wallet connections
- Added detailed logging for wallet connection attempts
- Added tests script for verifying wallet functionality

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Click on the "Login with Wallet" option
3. Use the "Debug Wallet" button to verify library availability
4. Use the test button (bottom right) to run wallet connection tests
5. Test connection with actual wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect)

## Security Considerations
- Alchemy API key is used securely
- No private keys are stored or transmitted
- Session data is stored in the browser's sessionStorage
- Wallet addresses are verified against authorized list

## Known Issues
- Some wallets might require HTTPS for proper functioning
- WalletConnect mobile connection may require additional testing
- Multiple simultaneous wallet connections are not supported (by design)

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more wallet types
- Enhance wallet connection recovery after page refresh
- Add network switching functionality
- Implement signature verification for enhanced security
